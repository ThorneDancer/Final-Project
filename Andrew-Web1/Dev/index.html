            <h1>WHAT IS PAX UNPLUGGED?</h1>
            <p>PAX Unplugged will be an exciting analog-focused extension of our already existing portfolio of PAX events. We've found that the Tabletop parts of PAX have grown aand grown to the point where we said "You know what? Lets make a show that's just that"</p>
            <article>
                <p>PAX Unplugged is an event specifically tailored to gamers of all ages. All of the content throughout the show is meant to be enjoyed by the entire family all weekend and what's more, Sunday's offerings are specifically set up to appeal to our younger gamers in attendance. It's with that in mind that we will be offering a Sunday Kid's Day badge for anyone under 12.</p>

            <h1>WHAT ARE ENFORCERS</h1>
            <p>As tens of thousands of attendees enjoy and experience the spectacle that is PAX, the incredible and often hidden work of the Enforcers hums like a well-oiled machine. This incredible group of several thousand individuals around the world tirelessly give a week or more of their lives each year, as literal blood, sweat, and tears make the show happen.</p>
            <p>What started as a volunteer workforce has grown into its own living and breathing community, focused on helping the game community at large. Not only do they ensure a well-run PAX, but they also assist with our charity, Child's Play, as well as a variety of community and Enforcer-run activities throughout the year.</p>
